# Gateway Events

Gateway connections are WebSockets, meaning they're bidirectional and either side of the WebSocket can send events to the other. The following events are split up into two types:

- **Send events** are Gateway events sent by a client to Discord (like when identifying with the Gateway)
- **Receive events** are Gateway events that are sent by Discord to a client. These events typically represent something happening inside of a guild where the user is a member of, like a channel being updated.

All Gateway events are encapsulated in a [Gateway payload](#gateway-payload-structure).

For more information about interacting with the Gateway, you can reference the [Gateway documentation](/topics/gateway).

### Event Names

In practice, event names are UPPER-CASED with under_scores joining each word in the name. For instance, [Channel Create](#channel-create) would be `CHANNEL_CREATE` and [Voice State Update](#voice-state-update) would be `VOICE_STATE_UPDATE`.

For readability, event names in the following documentation are typically left in Title Case.

### Gateway Payload Structure

Gateway event payloads have a common structure, but the contents of the associated data (`d`) varies between the different events.

| Field | Type        | Description                                                                                                                            |
| ----- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| op    | integer     | [Gateway OPCode](/topics/opcodes-and-status-codes#gateway-opcodes), which indicates the payload type                                   |
| d?    | ?JSON value | Event data                                                                                                                             |
| s?\*  | ?integer    | Sequence number of event used for [resuming sessions](/topics/gateway#resuming) and [heartbeating](/topics/gateway#sending-heartbeats) |
| t?\*  | ?string     | Event name for this payload (`DISPATCH` OPCode only)                                                                                   |

\* These fields are received only, and `null` when the `op` is not `DISPATCH`.

###### Example Gateway Payload (Send)

```json
{
  "op": 2,
  "d": {}
}
```

###### Example Gateway Payload (Receive)

```json
{
  "op": 0,
  "d": {},
  "s": 42,
  "t": "GATEWAY_EVENT_NAME"
}
```

## Send Events

Send events are Gateway events encapsulated in an [event payload](#gateway-payload-structure), and are sent by a client to Discord through a Gateway connection.

#### Ping Voice Server

}
```

#### Request Guild Members

Used to request all members for a guild or a list of guilds. When initially connecting, if you don't have the `GUILD_PRESENCES` [Gateway Intent](/topics/gateway#gateway-intents), or if the guild is over 75k members, it will only send members who are in voice, plus the member for you (the connecting user). Otherwise, if a guild has over `large_threshold` members (value in the [Gateway Identify](#identify)), it will only send members who are online, have a role, have a nickname, or are in a voice channel, and if it has under `large_threshold` members, it will send all members. If a client wishes to receive additional members, they need to explicitly request them via this operation. Fires multiple [Guild Members Chunk](#guild-members-chunk) events with up to 1000 members per chunk until all members that match the request have been sent.

Due to our privacy and infrastructural concerns with this feature, there are some limitations that apply:

- For bots, the `GUILD_PRESENCES` privileged intent is required to request presences
- For bots, the `GUILD_MEMBERS` privileged intent is required to request the entire member list (query of "" and limit of 0)
- For users, the `MANAGE_ROLES`, `KICK_MEMBERS`, or `BAN_MEMBERS` permissions are required to request the entire member list (query of "" and limit of 0)
- For bots, only one guild ID may be requested at a time
- Requesting a prefix (`query` parameter) will return a maximum of 100 members
- `user_ids` will be limited to 100 members

###### Request Guild Members Structure

| Field        | Type                             | Description                                                                                     |

| query?\*     | string                           | String that the username/nickname starts with, or an empty string to return all members         |
| limit?\*\*   | integer                          | Maximum number of members to send matching the `query` (0-100, must be 0 with an empty `query`) |
| presences?   | boolean                          | Whether the presence of matched members will be returned                                        |
| user_ids?\*  | snowflake or array of snowflakes | The user IDs to request (max 100)                                                               |
| nonce?\*\*\* | string                           | Nonce to identify the [Guild Members Chunk](#guild-members-chunk) response                      |

\* One of `query` or `user_ids` is required.

\*\* Required when specifying `query`.

\*\*\* The nonce can only be up to 32 bytes. If you send an invalid nonce it will be ignored and the reply member chunk(s) will not have a nonce set.

#### Request Call Connect

Used to request a private channel's pre-existing call data, created before the Gateway connection was established. Fires a [Call Create](#call-create) Gateway event if a call is found.

###### Request Call Connect Structure

| Field      | Type      | Description                      |
| ---------- | --------- | -------------------------------- |

```json
{
  "op": 12,
  "d": {
    "channel_id": "957057010334048288"
  }
}
```

## Receive Events

Received events are Gateway events encapsulated in an [event payload](#gateway-payload-structure), and are sent by Discord to a client through a Gateway connection. Received events correspond to events that happen relevant to the current user and the guilds it is a member of.

#### Hello

Sent on connection to the WebSocket. Defines the heartbeat interval that the client should heartbeat to.

###### Hello Structure

| Field              | Type          | Description                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| heartbeat_interval | integer       | The interval (in milliseconds) the client should heartbeat at                             |
| \_trace            | array[string] | An array of stringified JSON values representing the connection trace, used for debugging |

###### Example Hello

```json
{
  "op": 10,
  "d": {
    "heartbeat_interval": 41250,
    "_trace": ["[\"gateway-prd-us-east1-c-6w69\",{\"micros\":0.0}]"]
  }
}
```

#### Heartbeat ACK

Sent in response to receiving a heartbeat to acknowledge that it has been received.

Details about heartbeats are in the [Gateway documentation](/topics/gateway#sending-heartbeats).

###### Example Heartbeat ACK

```json
{
  "op": 11
}
```

#### Reconnect

The reconnect event is dispatched when a client should reconnect to the Gateway (and resume their existing session, if they have one). This event usually occurs during deploys to migrate sessions gracefully off old hosts.

###### Example Reconnect

```json
{
  "op": 7,
  "d": null
}
```

#### Invalid Session

Sent to indicate one of at least three different situations:

- The Gateway could not initialize a session after receiving an [Opcode 2 Identify](#identify)
- The Gateway could not resume a previous session after receiving an [Opcode 6 Resume](#resume)
- The Gateway has invalidated an active session and is requesting client action

The inner `d` key is a boolean that indicates whether the session may be resumable. See [Connecting](/topics/gateway#connecting) and [Resuming](/topics/gateway#resuming) for more information.

###### Example Invalid Session

```json
{
  "op": 9,
  "d": false
}
```

#### Ready

Sent when a client has completed the initial handshake with the Gateway (for new sessions). The ready event can be the largest and most complex event the Gateway will send, as it contains all the state required for a client to begin interacting with the rest of the platform.

`guilds` are the guilds of which you are a member. For bots, they start out as unavailable when they connect to the Gateway. As they become available, the bot will be notified via [Guild Create](#guild-create) events.

Sent when an application command's permissions are updated. The inner payload is an [application command permissions](/interactions/application-commands#guild-application-command-permissions-structure) object.

### Channels

#### Channel Create

Sent when a new guild channel is created, relevant to the current user. The inner payload is a [channel](/resources/channel#channel-object) object.

#### Channel Update

Sent when a channel is updated. The inner payload is a [channel](/resources/channel#channel-object) object. This is not sent when the field `last_message_id` is altered. To keep track of the `last_message_id` changes, you must listen for [Message Create](#message-create) events (or [Thread Create](#thread-create) events for `GUILD_FORUM` channels).

This event may reference roles or guild members that no longer exist in the guild.

#### Channel Delete

Sent when a channel relevant to the current user is deleted. The inner payload is a [channel](/resources/channel#channel-object) object.

- When a thread is created, includes an additional `newly_created` boolean field.
- When being added to an existing private thread, includes a [thread member](/resources/channel#thread-member-object) object.

#### Thread Update

Sent when a thread is updated. The inner payload is a [channel](/resources/channel#channel-object) object. This is not sent when the field `last_message_id` is altered. To keep track of the `last_message_id` changes, you must listen for [Message Create](#message-create) events.

#### Thread Delete

Sent when a thread relevant to the current user is deleted. The inner payload is a subset of the [channel](/resources/channel#channel-object) object, containing just the `id`, `guild_id`, `parent_id`, and `type` fields.

| last_pin_timestamp? | ?ISO8601 timestamp | the time at which the most recent pinned message was pinned |

### Guilds

#### Guild Create

This event can be sent in three different scenarios:

1.  When a user is initially connecting, to lazily load and backfill information for all unavailable guilds sent in the [Ready](#ready) event. Guilds that are unavailable due to an outage will send a [Guild Delete](#guild-delete) event.
2.  When a Guild becomes available again to the client.
3.  When the current user joins a new Guild.

<Alert type="info">

During an outage, the guild object in scenarios 1 and 3 may be marked as unavailable.

</Alert>

The inner payload can be:

- An available guild: a [guild](/resources/guild#guild-object) object with extra fields, as noted below.
- An unavailable guild: an [unavailable guild](/resources/guild#unavailable-guild-object) object.

### Messages

<Alert type="warn">

Unlike persistent messages, ephemeral messages are sent directly to the user and the bot who sent the message rather than through the guild channel. Because of this, ephemeral messages are tied to the [`DIRECT_MESSAGES` intent](/topics/gateway#list-of-intents), and the message object won't include `guild_id` or `member`.

</Alert>

### Presence

#### Presence Update

<Alert type="warn">

If you are using [Gateway Intents](/topics/gateway#gateway-intents), you _must_ specify the `GUILD_PRESENCES` intent in order to receive Presence Update events

</Alert>

A user's presence is their current state on a guild. This event is sent when a user's presence or info, such as name or avatar, is updated.

<Alert type="warn">

The user object within this event can be partial, the only field which must be sent is the `id` field, everything else is optional. Along with this limitation, no fields are required, and the types of the fields are **not** validated. Your client should expect any combination of fields and types within this event.

</Alert>

Activity asset images are arbitrary strings which usually contain snowflake IDs or prefixed image IDs. Treat data within this field carefully, as it is user-specifiable and not sanitized.

To use an external image via media proxy, specify the URL as the field's value when sending. You will only receive the `mp:` prefix via the Gateway.

| Type              | Format                   | Image URL                                                           |

## Endpoints

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/gateway" unauthenticated>
  Get Gateway
</RouteHeader>

Returns an object with a single valid WebSocket URL, which the client can use for [Connecting](#connecting). Clients **should** cache this value and only call this endpoint to retrieve a new URL if they are unable to properly establish a connection using the cached version of the URL.

###### Response Body

| Field | Type   | Description                                                      |

| url   | string | The WebSocket URL that can be used for connecting to the Gateway |

###### Example Response

```json
{
  "url": "wss://gateway.discord.gg/"
}
```

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/gateway/bot">
  Get Gateway Bot
</RouteHeader>

Returns an object based on the information in [Get Gateway](#get-gateway), plus additional metadata that can help during the operation of large or [sharded](#sharding) bots. Unlike [Get Gateway](#get-gateway), this route should not be cached for extended periods of time as the value is not guaranteed to be the same per-call, and changes as the user joins/leaves guilds.
